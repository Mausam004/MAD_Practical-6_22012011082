AIM:Create Android Application to demonstrate Frame by frame animation and splash screen to demonstrate twin animation.
This Android app demonstrates frame-by-frame animation and a splash screen with tween animation. The splash screen appears at launch with a tween animation effect (such as fade-in, zoom, or slide) to 
enhance the startup experience. After the splash screen, the app transitions to the main activity, where a frame-by-frame animation, using a sequence of drawable images, creates an animated effect (like a blinking 
icon or moving character). 
This project helps users understand how to implement both frame-based and tween animations to create smooth, engaging UI animations in Android.
